### Matryoshka Vision Transformers (MatViT)

This project implements MatViT in Scenic.

This is implemented according to the MatViT adaptation in the MatFormer paper, for details see
Devvrit et al., "MatFormer: Nested Transformer for Elastic Inference",
https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07707. This implementation provides the basic proof of concept and further optimizations can be applied to speed up the training.

If you are interested in using the code and/or pretrained models, please contact
